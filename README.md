# Project (Multiple Domains in PHP)
This is a simple project designed to demonstrate how to structure and work with multiple domains in PHP using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## The Problem
Imagine you're developing a system that involves multiple business domains, such as Billing, Charges, and Charges Reporting.
Each domain has its own set of entities, rules, and behaviors. One of the key challenges is maintaining consistency across these domains while respecting their boundaries.

For example, you might have a BillingDebtor entity in the Billing domain and a separate BillingDebtor in the Charges domain. Although they may share the same name, they represent different concepts or contain different data specific to their respective contexts.
